# Setup ReactJS Project on Local Machine

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
https://github.com/novative-hs/novative-hs-react.git
cd ilaaj4u-reactjs
```

Copy package.json and package-json.lock files from template files and add into the folder

Then install the dependencies:
```sh
 npm install --legacy-peer-deps --save
```

Once `npm` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
npm start
```
And navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`
