      External QC is an ISO 17043 accredited External Quality Assessment Scheme to ensure quality testing in laboratories. It is a system designed to objectively assess the quality results obtained by medical laboratories.
      
      External QC allows an individual laboratory to evaluate if its performance is satisfactory for the intended clinical purpose. Comparison of results among laboratories allows evaluation of the effectiveness of procedures in the field. This can give laboratories added confidence in reporting their patient test results as well as fulfill ISO 15189 and regulatory mandatory requirements. 
      
      We understand the importance of maintaining the highest quality standards in your laboratory, and thatâ€™s why we offer a comprehensive EQA/Proficiency Testing program to help you ensure the accuracy and reliability of your test results."
